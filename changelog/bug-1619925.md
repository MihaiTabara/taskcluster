Bug fix: taskcluster-proxy credential updates from task reclaims no longer race with taskcluster proxy process termination. Previously if a task completed just as the task was being reclaimed, it was possible for generic-worker to terminate the taskcluster-proxy process while it was HTTP posting updated credentials to it, which caused generic-worker to crash.
