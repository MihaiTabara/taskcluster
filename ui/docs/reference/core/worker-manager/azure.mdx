# Azure Provider Type

Azure-based providers create workers dynamically in Azure, within a single Resource Group.
Best practice is to use a dedicated resource group for each provider that is not shared with other uses.
This makes it easier to identify which resources a provider is responsible for.

## Removing Workers

A call to the `workerManager.removeWorker` API method for a worker managed by this provider type will result in an attempt to terminate the worker virtual machine and remove related resources.
Worker virtual machines have an associated NIC and public IP address which will also be deleted.

## Worker Interaction

The provider starts workers with an instance attribute named `taskcluster` containing a JSON object with the following properties:

* `workerPoolId` -- worker pool for this worker
* `providerId` -- provider ID that started the worker
* `workerGroup` -- the worker's workerGroup (currently equal to the providerId, but do not depend on this)
* `rootUrl` -- root URL for the Taskcluster deployment
* `workerConfig` -- worker configuration supplied as part of the worker pool configuration
* `userData` -- userData from the worker pool configuration (deprecated)

The worker's `workerId` is identical to its vmId, which can be retrieved from the Azure metadata service at `compute/vmId`.

The `workerIdentityProof` contains a [signed attested data document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service#attested-data) in its `document` property:

```json
{"document": "<signature>"}
```

The document should have audience equal to the deployment's `rootUrl` and `format=full`.

## Tags

The provider starts workers with the following labels.

 * `worker-pool-id` - the worker's workerPoolId
 * `managed-by` - `taskcluster`
 * `created-by` - `taskcluster-wm-<providerId>`
 * `owner` - the worker pool's owner

## Worker-Pool Configuration

Worker-pool configuration for a worker-pool using this provider type must match the following schema.

<SchemaTable schema="/schemas/worker-manager/v1/config-azure.json" />
