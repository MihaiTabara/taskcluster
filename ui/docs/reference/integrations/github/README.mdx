# Github Service
import Warning from 'taskcluster-ui/views/Documentation/components/Warning';

This service monitors all of the repositories associated with an organization for changes and schedules Taskcluster tasks for any repository which contains a `.taskcluster.yml` configuration file.
The goal of this project is to provide project owners a method for scheduling jobs in Taskcluster which is quick and straight forward.

<Warning>
This project used to provide a base docker image for convenience's sake, but it has been deprecated due to not being that useful and not being kept up-to-date. The image will continue existing, but we recommend migrating to another image.
</Warning>

### Adding status badges to your project's README:

To include a badge showing the status of the latest build, insert the following string (replacing the words in caps with your Taskcluster root URL, organization or user name, repository name and the branch name) to the README.md file in your project's repository:
`[![Task Status](https://ROOTURL/api/github/v1/repository/USERNAME/REPONAME/BRANCHNAME/badge.svg)](https://ROOTURL/api/github/v1/repository/USERNAME/REPONAME/BRANCHNAME/latest)`
