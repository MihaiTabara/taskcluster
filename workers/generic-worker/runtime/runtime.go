// that could potentially affect security. Prefixed with `pWd0_` to ensure
// password contains a special character (_), lowercase and uppercase letters,
// and a number. This is useful if the OS has a strict password policy
// requiring all of these. The total password length is 29 characters (24 of
// which are random). 29 characters should not be too long for the OS. The 24
// random characters of [A-Za-z0-9] provide (26+26+10)^24 possible permutations
// (approx 143 bits of randomness). Randomisation is not seeded, so results
// should not be reproducible.
